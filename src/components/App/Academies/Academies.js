          There are four disciplines available: for developers, testers,
          front-end developers and kids. Academies are taking place in Devbridge
          Lithuanian offices. Students, who are willing to join developers,
          testers or Front-End academies, need to pass the test, prove their
          best to get an invitation to enroll. This rule doesnâ€™t apply to the
          kids (7 to 12 years old) academy, the admission is limited only by
          available number of entries.
